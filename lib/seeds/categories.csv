broccoli,,https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/457221-200.png,3,TRUE,"Loosely wrap the broccoli heads with a paper towel so that the towel absorbs some of the moisture. Keep in the fridge.

Note\, keep ripe melons away from other fruit so that the ethylene gas that they produce does not speed up the ripening of the fruit.",,
brussels_sprouts,,https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/436910-200.png,7,TRUE,"Store brussels sprouts in a plastic bag in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator.

eggplant,,https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/667038-200.png,4,FALSE,"Eggplant is likely to last longer when stored at room temperature. Keep eggplant in a cool spot\, away from direct sunlight\, and use it as soon as possible after harvesting or buying. You can place it in a vented bowl\, but avoid sealing it in a plastic bag\, which can increase decay. Note\, eggplant is similar to cucumber in that it is temperature\-sensitive and ethylene\-sensitive. Cooked eggplant may be refrigerated up to three days.",,
corn,,https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/407218-200.png,5,TRUE,"Place ears of corn in your refrigerator as soon as possible. Leave the husk on\, if possible\, and let the corn sit in the fridge uncovered.

Do not store whole onions in plastic bags. Lack of air movement will reduce their storage life. One way to extend the shelf life of a sweet or high water content onion is to wrap each one in paper towels or newspaper and place them in the refrigerator to keep them cool and dry. Chopped or sliced onions can be stored in a sealed container in your refrigerator at the proper temperature of 40 degrees F or below for seven to 10 days.",,
